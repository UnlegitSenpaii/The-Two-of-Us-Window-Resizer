# TToU Window Changer

Hello.
If you're here, it means you also don't like that the game "The Two of Us"  is starting in windowed mode as well as the fullscreen mode not being implemented correctly.

It also uses your monitor's native resolution and not the predefined window resolution of the game.

## Usage
You can download the most recent release in the release section.
When starting the app, you can choose between the following:

 0. Maximised Window
 1. Borderless Window
 2. Borderless Window with Mouse Lock

Simply type the number of the mode you want when asked for it.
